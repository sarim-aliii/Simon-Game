The Simon Game is an electronic memory game invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, introduced in the late 1970s. The device features four large buttons in different colors — typically red, green, blue, and yellow — each producing a distinct tone when pressed.

How It Works:
The game starts with Simon lighting up one of the buttons and playing its corresponding sound.

The player must press the same button.

Simon then repeats the original signal and adds one more step to the sequence.

The player must repeat the full sequence in order.

This continues, with the sequence getting longer and more challenging after each successful round.

Objective:
Repeat the sequence for as long as possible without making a mistake. A wrong input ends the game.

Purpose:
Enhances short-term memory and concentration

Often used as a fun tool to improve pattern recognition and attention span
